# shapes - a java math library
Projectstem.org allows you to do your coding for their Computer Science A course all inside of the browser. This stopped becoming a choice once they intrudced lessons where they force you to use a propriotary math library called "shapes" that projectstem made. It is propriotary in the fact that they offer no download or way to run the compiled .class or .jar files on your local machine.

# solution
My solution to this problem of them not giving the freedom to code and compile the answers of the lessons locally was to re-create their library as faithfully as possible based off the documentation given on their site (their documentation: https://coderunner.projectstem.org/docs/shapes/index.html) 
 
Their documentation should also work as documentation for my re-creation, up to multiple edge cases I have yet to practically encounter.

# compilation
The way to compile a .java file is to use `javac`
